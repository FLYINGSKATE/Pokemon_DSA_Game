## 🗺️ Journey Overview
You start as a **Rookie Trainer** in the Kanto Region, catching your first data structures. As you progress, you'll:
- Catch and master algorithms ("Pokemon")
- Evolve your knowledge into advanced forms
- Defeat Gym Leaders (major concepts)
- Collect badges
- Build your ultimate interview team
- Face the Elite Four and become the **Algorithm Champion**

Each algorithm and data structure is presented as a Pokemon card and Pokedex entry, complete with C++ code, stats, and special moves!

---

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Pick a Region:** Start with Kanto (basic data structures) and unlock more as you progress.
2. **Catch Algorithms:** Open collapsible sections to "catch" each concept.
3. **Train & Evolve:** Study the C++ code, understand the stats, and solve real LeetCode problems.
4. **Challenge Gyms:** Test your skills with Gym Leader challenges and earn badges.
5. **Build Your Team:** Combine algorithms for different interview scenarios.
6. **Become Champion:** Defeat the Elite Four and take on the Champion Battle!

## 📖 Pokedex: Algorithms & Data Structures
Catch, train, and evolve your DSA Pokemon! Each entry includes:
- **Pokemon Card:** Quick stats, type, rarity, and moveset
- **Pokedex Entry:** Description, habitat (where to find), and evolution chain
- **C++ Code:** Implementation with "Pokemon stats" (complexity analysis)
- **LeetCode Encounters:** Real problems to practice

### Example: (Click to expand)

<details>
<summary>🎯 A wild <b>STACK</b> appeared! Click to catch it!</summary>

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  🪙 STACK                   │
│  Type: Data Structure       │
│  Rarity: ★★☆☆☆              │
│  ─────────────────────────  │
│  Time Complexity: O(1)      │
│  Space Complexity: O(n)     │
│  ─────────────────────────  │
│  Special Move: Push/Pop     │
│  Effective Against: LIFO    │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**STACK: The LIFO Pokemon.**
Known for its ability to reverse order and match parentheses. 
Habitat: Function calls, expression evaluation.

**C++ Implementation:**
```cpp
#include <stack>
std::stack<int> myStack;
myStack.push(10);
myStack.pop();
```

**Where to find in the wild:**
- [Valid Parentheses (LeetCode 20)](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
- [Min Stack (LeetCode 155)](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)

**Evolution:**
- STACK → QUEUE → DEQUE

✨ STACK was caught! STACK was added to your Pokedex!
